we first decompile the code in c

we can see that we can get an segmentation fault with the 76 digits in the input
also we can see the program have an function named run that exectutes a shell but it is not accessible from main like the level before

so we will need to use the buffer overflow to call that function

to do so first we need no know the address of that function, the offset in this case is easy 76 and yeah that is all


first we get the adress running the program trough gdb and extracting the value with info functions

0x08048444

so we can do the python script to create a custom payload 

python -c 'print "a" * 76 + "\x08\x04\x84\x44"[::-1]' > payload


and then we execute the payload with pipes to exploit the binnary



why we can replace the adress, first we need to understand the concept of the return, when the return is called the stack is being used to change,
in this case the offset match with the offset of the string, but is not allways the case, so we will need to make sure how the edp is being called

we need to calculate the offset
