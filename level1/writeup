we first decompile the code in c

we can see that we can get an segmentation fault with the 76 digits in the input
also we can see the program have an function named run that exectutes a shell but it is not accessible from main like the level before

so we will need to use the buffer overflow to call that function

to do so first we need no know the address of that function, the offset in this case is easy 76 and yeah that is all


first we get the adress running the program trough gdb and extracting the value with info functions
